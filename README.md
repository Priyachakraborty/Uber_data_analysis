PROJECT ANALYSIS ->

Uber uses a mixture of internal and external data to estimate fares. Uber calculates fares automatically using street traffic data, GPS data and its own algorithms that make alterations based on the time of the journey. It also analyses external data like public transport routes to plan various services.By doing this project ,we can now easily get the idea of how Uber analyse data based on previous dataset.
